# Advent of Code 2025

my [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) solutions in go

I use aoc to learn go after finishing all but one puzzle in [zig](https://github.com/SuSonicTH/aoc2025)

My goal is to translate my solutions from zig into (hopefully) ideomatic go code to learn the basics of go
